"""Top-level package for the Travel Order Resolver project.

This package exposes the core modules used to build the end-to-end
processing pipeline that turns a natural-language travel order into
structured information.

The concrete business logic for each step (NLP, graph construction,
and routing) is intentionally left unimplemented at this stage.
